# This file is part of the pdnsd package.

# This file contains information about the RR types implemented in pdnsd
# and is used for generating rr_types.h.
# It was derived from the following source: http://www.bind9.net/dns-parameters
#
# After making modifications to this file the file rr_types.h should be regenerated!
#
# Info about the format of this file:
#   Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored, all other lines
#   are assumed to define an RR type. Lines starting with '+' define most
#   frequently used types. An RR type preceded by a '-' will not be cached
#   by pdnsd. The next two fields are interpreted as the name and the value
#   of the RR type, resp. A subsequent word in parenthesis will be interpreted a
#   class name (used for conflict resolution). Remaining fields are ignored.
#
# Adding or removing an initial '+' can be done safely without requiring
# changes to the source code (other than regenerating rr_types.h).
#
# If you are sure that you will never use certain RR types you can disable
# caching for them and make pdnsd slightly more efficient by placing a
# '-' sign in front of the lines that define those types.
# For a list of obsolete RR types see e.g.
#   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types .
# Note that some RR types are essential for pdnsd; these are currently:
#   A, NS, CNAME, SOA, PTR, MX and (if you want IPv6 support) AAAA.
# Disabling caching for these types will cause pdnsd to fail to compile
# or cause a fatal run-time error.
#
# Removing a '-' sign to enable caching can be risky if the support in
# the pdnsd code is missing or inadequate, so only do this if you really know
# what you are doing. SPF records are supported, however, so it should be safe
# to enable caching for them.
