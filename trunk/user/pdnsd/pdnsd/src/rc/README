rc/
===

These are start scripts for different Linux distros and other things that
do not directly belong to pdnsd. 
If you do start scripts for the distro you use, please GPL them and send 
them in, so that they can be included in this package for other users.
Note that there is NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND on anything in this directory;
read the COPYING that comes with pdnsd for details.
So far there are files in the following directories:

SuSE
----
pdnsd	- Start script for SuSE Linux. Tested for 6.? but should run on some
	  versions below. You can do 'make install' as root in the SuSE 
	  directory to install it, or you can install manually:
	  --manual installation-------------------------------------------------
	  For manual installation, copy it into /sbin/init.d/, go to
	  /sbin/init.d/rc2.d/ and create there the following two symlinks:
	S11pdnsd -> ../pdnsd (do "ln -s ../pdnsd S11pdnsd" in that dir)
	K34pdnsd -> ../pdnsd (do "ln -s ../pdnsd K34pdnsd" in that dir)
	  The numbers dictate the order different services are started and 
	  might need to be modified. Then edit your /etc/rc.config file and
	  add the line "START_PDNSD=yes" to start pdnsd at boot time.
	  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
	  If you used the 'make install' command, "START_PDNSD=yes" has been
	  appended to your /etc/rc.config file, causing pdnsd to be started
	  at boot time. If you don't want that, change the "yes" into "no". 
	  This start script was created from /sbin/init.d/skeleton by me, so the
	  most is copyrighted by SuSE. They put it under the GPL, however, so
	  the licence stated in COPYING also applies to this script.
          This is no official SuSE script, and SuSE naturally does NO support 
	  for it.

Redhat
------
The contents of the Redhat directory and the following documentation were 
contributed by Torben Janssen. Thanks a lot!

pdnsd	- Start script for Redhat Linux. Tested for 6.1 but should run on 5.0+.
	  You can do 'make install' as root in the Redhat directory to
	  install it, or you can install manually:
	    
	  --manual installation-------------------------------------------------
	  For manual installation, copy pdnsd into /etc/rc.d/init.d/
		
	  Then go to /etc/rc.d/rc3.d and create there the following symlink:
	  S78pdnsd -> ../init.d/pdnsd 
	  (do "ln -f -s ../init.d/pdnsd S78pdnsd" in that dir)
		
	  Then go to /etc/rc.d/rc0.d and create there the following symlink:
	  K78pdnsd -> ../init.d/pdnsd 
	  (do "ln -f -s ../init.d/pdnsd K78pdnsd" in that dir)
		
	  Then go to /etc/rc.d/rc6.d and create there the following symlink:
	  K78pdnsd -> ../init.d/pdnsd 
	  (do "ln -f -s ../init.d/pdnsd K78pdnsd" in that dir)
		
	  WHY
	  ---
	  the rc[0-6].d dirs includes the scripts which starts/stops the 
	  services on entering runlevel [0-6]
	  the interesting runlevels on Redhat are: 
	  0 - halt
	  3 - multi user system
	  6 - reboot
	  The links have an 'S' or 'K' and a number at the beginnig. All links
	  with 'S' starts the script on entering the runlevel and 'K' stops 
	  them.
	  So, there's an 'S' link in rc3 and 'K' links in rc0 and rc6.
	  I choose 78 as number, because there was no script with this number on
	  my system. You can choose every number you want, AFAIK .
	
	  This is no offical Redhat script, and Redhat naturally does NO support
	  for it.

Debian
------
The contents of the Debian directory were contributed by Markus Mohr. 
His installation instructions are (translated):
Install the pdnsd script to /etc/init and run 
update-rc.d pdnsd defaults 19
as root.

Slackware
---------
A Slackware start-up script rc.pdnsd was contributed by Nikola Kotur <kotnik@ns-linux.org>.
His comments were:

Slackware uses traditional BSD style init script layout instead of SystemV 
style startup scripts.  So I adjusted the start-up script for pdnsd, and 
now it can be used with Slackware 9.1 distribution, and probably with all the 
others.

Additional info:
1) put these lines in the /etc/rc.d/rc.M:
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.pdnsd ]; then
		/etc/rc.d/rc.pdnsd start
	fi

2) put these lines in the /etc/rc.d/rc.6 and /etc/rc.d/rc.K:
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.pdnsd ]; then
		/etc/rc.d/rc.pdnsd stop
	fi
