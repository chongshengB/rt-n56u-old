This directory contains user-contributed scripts for use with pdnsd.
So far there are:

pdnsd_dhcp.pl, save_ram.pl
	A perl script contributed by Marko Stolle (derived from a script by
	Mike Stella) to watch a ISC DHCPD leases file and add local records for
	the hosts listed there. This makes pdnsd useable in a DHCP setup.
	Please look into the script for usage instructions (you will probably
	also need to customize some settings there).
	For details about save_ram.pl, please look into pdnsd_dhcp.pl

dhcp2pdnsd
	A rc script for pdnsd, also by Marko Stolle. You might need to change
	it slightly to make it run with your distro.

change_pdnsd_server_ip.pl
	A perl script contributed by Paul Rombouts for automatically updating
	the configuration file if the DNS server configuration has changed.
	For instance, you could place the following line in the script
	/sbin/ifup-local

	/usr/local/sbin/change_pdnsd_server_ip.pl isplabel "$DNS" /etc/pdnsd.conf

	where $DNS contains the IP addresses (in comma separated format) of the
	DNS servers obtained by DHCP negotiation. The perl script only
	overwrites /etc/pdnsd.conf if the DNS configuration has actually
	changed, in which case the previous configuration file is saved as
	/etc/pdnsd.conf.save
