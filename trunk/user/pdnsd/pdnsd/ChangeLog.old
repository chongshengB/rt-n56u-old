2000-02-15
	Version 0.2. First working alpha with the extended feature set.

2000-02-16
	Version 0.3 with many bugfixes, better standard conformity and
	some new features.

2000-02-17
	Did a lint on the code, implemented soft timeouts, again bugfixes,
	drastically reduced cache memory requirements, implemented local 
	records.
	Version 0.4 released.

2000-02-19
	Recursive query finally implemented. Version 0.5 out.

2000-02-20
	Various bugfixes. The server now always tries to get an AA answer
	if possible; this implies recursion. This is to deal better with
	caching servers that may return incomplete results on * queries.
	This may be a little sub-optimal since it may not take the full
	effect of caching, but it is the only real possibility of getting
	complete records.
	Redid the deps in the makefile for now.
	Version is now 0.6.

2000-02-21
	Another set of bugfixes. Version is 0.6.1.

2000-02-22
	Another set of bugfixes. It should stabilize by now. Answer compression
	is there finally. Version is therefore up again, 0.7 by now.

2000-02-23
	Minor bugfixes, isdn interface uptest added. The new record types as of
	rfc1700 are implemented, but as a compile-time option, since normally
	there is no need to waste space for them.
	Version is 0.7.1.

2000-02-24
	Version 0.7.2 with all rrs up to KX (36). #define DNS_NEW_RRS in 
	config.h and (re)compile if you want to use them. Delete the cache
	file before using a version with this option changed!  
	NSAP-PTR does NOT WORK (any incoming answer containing it may cause 
	a format error) because it is ill-designed (see	TODO). Never mind, it 
	is officially deprecated anyway.
	The secure DNS extension record types defined in RFC 2065 (KEY, SIG,
	NXT) are cached only and therefore useless.

2000-02-26
	Version 0.8 with parallel query (and probably new bugs) introduced.

2000-02-27
	Version 0.8.1 with minor bugfixes on the new features.

2000-02-27
	Version 0.8.5 with authority support and the usual bugifxes. Some issues
	with standard conformity were also fixed (wow, two versions a day).

2000-02-28
	Implemented caching of non-authoritative records. This allows better 
	usage of other caching name servers. This may return non-authoritative
	records to any non-wildcard query. If a wildcard query arrives, we 
	always look for authoritative records, so we do if the non-authoritative
	answer does not contain at least one answering record to the query.
	This fixes the sub-optimal behaviour since 0.6.
	Version is therefore up to 0.8.7 (0.8.6 was also released today 
	containing bugfixes)

2000-02-29
	Better thread support, avoiding deadlocks in signal handling. The cost 
	is unfortunately one more thread.
	New option server_port in config file.
	Version is 0.8.8.

2000-03-01
	Nailed a renitent memory leak bug to the wall (shame, what a trivial 
	mistake). Also improved handling of error conditions slightly.
	Version is 0.8.9.

2000-03-01
	Cache code cleanup. The development of the non-parallel query code
	is discontinued, although it still works. If you want serial query,
	just set PAR_QUERIES to 1.
	Additional information finally implemented.
	We are up to 0.9.

2000-03-02
	Fixed a DoS possibility.
	More rfc compatability fixups and a smarter resolver logic.
	Version 0.9.1

2000-03-02
	Added the source section to the config file handling. This allows to 
	source your /etc/hosts file. Version 0.9.2.

2000-03-02
	Avoiding double additional records now. Version 0.9.3.

2000-03-09
	Fixed some REALLY STUPID bugs. Uuummph, thought it was finished. 
	However, the number of bugs remaining is always n+1...
	Anyway, we are up to 0.9.4. Hope that there are no mean bugs left.

2000-03-14
	Added another uptest, exec. See README for details. Also grained the 
	cache size finer (it's now specified in kB). Version 0.9.5

2000-04-07
	Fixed some really stupid bugs, what else? Version is 0.9.6
	To be more exact: fixed misc bugs, cleaned up hash.c and cache.c

2000-04-20
	Again fixed some bugs, version is now 0.9.7.

2000-04-29
	Fixed a build problem caused by some missing #defines in glibc2.0 and a
	minor bug.
	Version is up to 0.9.8

2000-04-30
	Fixed some unclean C code and did a general C lint. Thanks to Byrial 
	Jensen for pointing out some issues. Now using stricter compiler flags.
	Also replaced the daemon() call in main.c for improved portability.
	Pre-Released 0.9.9p1

2000-05-03
	Released 0.9.9p2 with the changes of 0.9.9p1, Documentation updates, 
	bugfixes, and the Red Hat rc scripts contributed by Torben Janssen.
	Also, the meaning of the command line option -v has changed.
	There is a new config file option "lean_query" that is on by
	default. It is an optimization, so please look in the docs when
	updating whether you want it switched on or not.
	Removed the long-dead serial query code from the distribution tree.
	Some resolvers seem to be broken somehow in a respect that it cares 
	about order in which the records appear. In particular, it wants 
	cname to appear before other records. Ok, so it be...


2000-05-04
	Save all names in lower case in the rrs.
	Tidying up the source tree.
	The long-awaited cache structure changes have been started. Please
	delete you cache files before using this new release.

2000-05-05
	Fixed several bugs in the old and in the new source tree.
	Use time_t instead of long for internal time storage for compatibility.


2000-05-06
	Version 0.9.10.
	This fixes a bug in uptest=if. Red Hat and configuration fixes 
	suggested by Soeren J. Peters were included.

2000-05-08
	Version 0.9.11
	This fixes a locally exploitable security problem (pdnsd.cache was 
	world-writeable). This is actually a one-line fix; for a description of
	possible dangers, please refer to the html documentation.
	Thanks to Alan Swanson for reporting.
