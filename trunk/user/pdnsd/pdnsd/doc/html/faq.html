	  pdnsd does not aim to be a complete name server implementation, such as the
	  BIND. It is optimized for caching, and you can only specify a small subset of all
	  dns record types pdnsd knows in your local &quot;zone&quot; definitions.
	  This of course reduces the code size drastically, and such the memory footprint.
	  There are some features especially interesting for dialin networks, ordinary
	  (non-server) internet hosts and computers that are often not connected to
	  to their network, e.g. notebooks (I originally wrote this program for use
	  with my notebook).
	  These features are:
	  <ul>
	    <li> permanent disk cache (useful for frequent power-offs/reboots)
	    <li> usually smaller memory footprint (depends on cache size) (see next question)
	    <li> offline-detection prevents hangs (e.g. the typical hang on startup of some
	      Netscape Navigator versions if not dialled in)
	    <li> better control about timeouts (also to prevent hangs)
	    <li> better control over the cache
	    <li> better run-time control

	  When I look at the process size with ps, top, gtop, or a similar tool, I see
	  some processes with a total size well above 3.5 MB. This is much more than
	  e.g. BIND named (about 1.4 MB). Why?

	  Really, it is not.
	  pdnsd uses multithreading, not multiprocessing. That means that the processes
	  share most of their process space. In the LinuxThreads library
	  or NPTL (Native Posix Thread Libary),
	  which are used by pdnsd on Linux, in fact the total process address space is shared
	  (although the processes have different stacks, these are in one process
	  address space). You may check this by looking at the at the process sizes of
	  the  pdnsd threads: all should be the same. The effective size that pdnsd
	  occupies is thus the size of any of the processes, not the sum of those.
	  So, pdnsd with empty cache occupies about 800 kB, and the maximum size
	  should be about the cache size plus this size (in fact, ca 5-10% more).

	      see which servers are regarded to be available
	    <li> mark servers as available or unavailable, or force a status retest - very
	      handy if you want to control which servers pdnsd queries, e.g for muliple
	      dial-up accounts
	    <li> delete, invalidate or add DNS records - useful e.g. when you want to build

	  Some resolver programs, e.g. nslookup, want to look up the name of the
	  server they are using before doing anything else. This option is for defining
	  a PTR record for your IP such that those programs get an answer even if the
	  name server you are caching is not available or does not offer these records.
	  By extension, you may also define A and SOA records. This allows you to build
	  very small zones without having to use a &quot;big&quot; name server. It is NOT
	  intended to replace such a complete server in anything but VERY small
	  networks. Alternatively, you may start a named on another host or on the
	  same host on another port and cache it with pdnsd in addition to other (more
	  distant) name servers.
	  <br>
	  The <code>source</code> section allows you to let pdnsd read in your
	  <code>/etc/hosts</code> file on startup and serve its contents. This file is used by your local
	  resolver before it even  tries the name servers and usually contains
	  fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs) for all of the internet addresses your host has.
	  If you source this file, you usually won't need any additional <code>rr</code> sections. Sourcing it also allows
	  other hosts (eg. in your local network) to access the names defined in your
	  hosts file. You can of course just add other hosts in your local network to the
	  servers <code>hosts</code> file, thus making them known to your server's resolver
	  and pdnsd (if you sourced that file).
	  <br>
	  If you don't know what this answer was all about, you should just take the
	  source section in the sample config file that comes with pdnsd, copy it
	  into your config file and forget about it.

	  Normally, this macros should be defined in your C library's header files.
	  There are two different methods, most C libraries support both (and pdnsd
	  honors both): either <code>__BYTE_ORDER</code> is set to <code>__LITTLE_ENDIAN</code>
	  or <code>__BIG_ENDIAN</code>, or <code>__LITTLE_ENDIAN</code> or <code>__BIG_ENDIAN</code>
	  are directly defined as macros.
	  <br>
	  Linux glibc, for example, does set those macros correctly. Never mind. You just have to know
	  whether your machine is little-endian or big-endian, this means wheter your
	  machine saves the least significant byte of a word or double-word first in memory (little-endian) or
	  the most significant first (big-endian).
	  All intel x86 and Alpha machines are little-endian, for example, while SPARC
	  and PowerPC architectures are big-endian.
	  If your machine is little-endian, add the following line to your config.h:
	  <br><code>
	    #define __BYTE_ORDER __LITTLE_ENDIAN
	  </code><br>
	  Likewise, if your machines byte order is big-endian:
	  <br><code>
	    #define __BYTE_ORDER __BIG_ENDIAN
	  </code><br>
	  Pathological byte orders like pdp-endian are not yet supported really;
	  However, for the place the endianess is needed, <code>__LITTLE_ENDIAN</code> should do
	  (it deals only with 16 bits; for all other occurances, ntoh[sl]/hton[sl] is used).

	  This warning only occurs if you use the <code>uptest=exec</code> option in your

	  because pdnsd is running as root, and this was not explicitely specified.
	  The idea is that it may introduce security holes (in the programs being run)
	  when they run as root, and so they shouldn't do that if possible.
	  You can specify the user that shall run the command by appending its name
	  comma-separated as string to the <code>uptest_cmd</code> line: <br>
	  <code>
	    uptest_cmd=&quot;&lt;your command&gt;&quot;,&quot;&lt;user&gt;&quot;;

	  pdnsd has an option (<code>uptest=exec</code>) that allows the execution of arbitrary
	  shell code (for testing whether an interface is up). This must be
	  of course secured against unauthorized use. One of these
	  protection is the one that produces the error message: if you routinely run
	  pdnsd, e.g. at system startup, and your config file is editable for others,
	  someone could change it and insert shell code that is executed in the next
	  pdnsd run -- with your user privileges! To prevent this, pdnsd will exit if the config file is writeable
	  by others than the owner.
	  To get rid of this message, just do <br>
	  <code>
	    chmod go-w &lt;filename&gt;
	  </code><br>
	  on your config
	  file (for the default file: <code>chmod go-w /etc/pdnsd.conf</code>).

	  In some cases pdnsd will not consider the answer of the local name server
	  authoritative enough, and will try to get answers from the name servers listed in the
	  authority section of the reply message. If pdnsd is behind a firewall that blocks the
	  UDP reply packets from remote name servers, pdnsd will wait in vain for a reply.
	  One solution is to set <a href="doc.html#proxyonly"><code>proxy_only=on</code></a>
	  in the servers sections of the configuration file.
	  This will prevent pdnsd from querying name servers that are not listed in the configuration
	  file.
	  Another solution that can be tried is specifying
	  <a href="doc.html#querymethod"><code>query_method=tcp_only</code></a>
	  in the global section of the configuration file, because a firewall that blocks
	  UDP packets from outside might still allow outgoing TCP connections to port 53.

	  Is pdnsd vulnerable to DNS cache poisoning as described in

	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td bgcolor="#FFCCFF"><b>A:</b></td>
	<td bgcolor="#DDFFEE">
	  Short answer: Yes.<br>
	  Somewhat longer answer: The problem is not so much that pdnsd's implementation is flawed
	  but rather that the DNS protocol currently being used is fundamentally flawed from
	  a security viewpoint. As long as a more secure protocol is not in place,
	  all that the developers of pdnsd can do is to try to tweak the current implementation
	  to make it as difficult as possible for an attacker to succeed.<br>
	  From version 1.2.7 onwards, the default for the <code>query_port_start</code> option
	  is 1024, which means that the pdnsd resolver will randomly select source ports
	  in the range 1024-65535. (In previous versions the default was to let the kernel select
	  the source ports, which will often result in a more or less predictable sequence of ports.)
	  It also helps to use a good quality source of random numbers. On platforms where this is
	  supported, it is preferable to configure with <code>--with-random-device=/dev/urandom</code>.
	  There is still more that can be done to make pdnsd less vulnerable, but this remains
	  (as of this writing) a work in progress.
	  <br>
	  Please note that pdnsd was designed for small (private) networks, and that it is generally
	  not recommended to let untrusted users access pdnsd.
