Most of pdnsd was written by Thomas Moestl (tmoestl@gmx.net).
In the "par" versions large parts of the code have been revised
and several features have been added by Paul Rombouts.

Small parts of this program are based on code that  was taken from nmap (IP 
checksumming), the isdn4k-utils (ippp interface uptest), glibc 2.1.2 (some
definitions for kernel 2.2.x missing in 2.0 glibcs) and FreeBSD
(SIZEOF_ADDR_IFREQ in netdev.c).
nmap was written by Fyodor. The insd4k-utils were written by Fritz Elfert and
others. The GNU C library (glibc) is copyright by the Free Software 
Foundation.
